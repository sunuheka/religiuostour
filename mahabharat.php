                <p>In the Mahaparinirvana sutra, the Buddha tells his followers that they can attain merit and a noble rebirth by going on pilgrimage to the places where he was born Lumbini, gained enlightenment <a href="">Bodhgaya</a> , first taught <a href="">Sarnath</a>, and attained Nirvana <a href="">Kushinagar</a> .</p>

                <p>The <a href="">Buddhist tourist train</a> takes you to these places and helps you experience firsthand the self disciplined and legendary life of Lord Buddha.</p>

                <p>India, the country where <a href="">Buddhism</a> originated has rich memories of the Buddhist legacy. As part of its drive towards austerity, the only kind of art and architecture that it supported were <a href="">Stupas</a> (stone cased moulds that commemorated relics of Buddha), Chaityas (prayer halls) and Viharas (cells for the monks). Buddhist Train India will help you visit all these places up close for a truly religious experience.</p>

<p>Come, discover the path to <a href="">enlightenment</a>, towards Buddha by train.</p>
